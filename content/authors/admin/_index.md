I am a Climate and Communities Social Scientist for the Pacific States Marine Fisheries Commission in support of the Alaska Fisheries Science Center in Juneau, Alaska. In this role, I advance social science on climate change adaptation and resilience through the [**Gulf of Alaska Climate Integrated Modeling Project**](https://www.fisheries.noaa.gov/alaska/ecosystems/gulf-alaska-climate-integrated-modeling-project), in particular GOA-CLIM Theme 3—[**From Climate to Communities**](https://www.fisheries.noaa.gov/alaska/socioeconomics/gulf-alaska-climate-integrated-modeling-socioeconomics-climate-communities)—led by Dr. Marysia Szymkowiak. Since 2020, I have contributed to quantitative and qualitative research in Gulf of Alaska fishing communities to understand their resilience to present and future climate change impacts.

I am also an applicant to doctoral programs on the 2023-'24 cycle. I look forward to studying applied economics and interdisciplinary social science, with particular interest in climate change impacts and cascading failures in networks of fishing businesses.
